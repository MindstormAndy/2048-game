This is a simple 2048 game that I created as one of my personal coding projects.
This is not an original game - the original can be found on this website: https://play2048.co/
The goal is to combine the tiles to get the 2048 tile. 
You can choose what board size you want to play with, from 2x2 to 6x6, though
4x4 is the classic version.
